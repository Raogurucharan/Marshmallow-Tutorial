# Marshmallow-Tutorial

The Python ecosystem has many great libraries for data formatting and schema validation.
In fact, marshmallow was influenced by a number of these libraries. Marshmallow is inspired by Django REST Framework, Flask-RESTful, and colander. It borrows a number of implementation and design ideas from these libraries to create a flexible and productive solution for marshalling, unmarshalling, and validating data.

OKK...lets keep it SIMPLE:

So Marshmallow basically helps to serialize , deserialize and validation of data in python. For example converting basic data types like array, dict, list into complex objects in python and viceversa.
